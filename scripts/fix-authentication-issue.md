# Fix "Failed to fetch profile" Authentication Issue

## Problem Analysis

Your database is correctly configured and has active profiles. The issue is with Supabase session authentication not being properly established.

## Solutions (try in this order)

### 1. **_Clear Authentication Session & Sign In Again_**

- Clear all browser cookies for your localhost/development site
- Delete any saved local storage for your app
- Restart the development server: `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
- Sign in again through your app's authentication flow
- Check that the session cookies are being set properly

### 2. **_Check Environment Variables_**

Ensure you have these environment variables configured:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### 3. **_Force Sign In Through App_**

1. Go to your `/sign-in` page
2. Complete the authentication flow
3. Do NOT manually call `/api/profile` - let the app handle it
4. Check browser's developer tools → Network tab to see if the authentication requests succeed

### 4. **_Debug Session in Browser_**

Open browser developer tools:

- Console tab → check for errors
- Storage tab → check if auth cookies are being saved
- Network tab → check if session requests are being made

### 5. **_Create Request as Authenticated User_**

If you need to test API endpoints:

- Use the browser with the authentication session
- Use fetch with credentials: `fetch('/api/profile', { credentials: 'include' })`
- Do NOT use external tools like Postman without proper session management

### 6. **_Manual Session Verification_**

Try visiting the app's admin page or dashboard to trigger the normal authentication flow.

## Why This Happens

1. **Development vs. Production contexts**: The session management needs to be consistent
2. **Cookie domain/path issues**: Session cookies might not be properly set for API routes
3. **Supabase session lifecycle**: Sessions may have expired or been invalidated
4. **Browser session storage**: Authentication tokens not persisting correctly

## Check Success

You'll know it works when:

- Loading the app shows your authenticated user information
- API calls return 200 responses instead of 401/403
- Browser's app state shows authenticated user data

This happens in the _browser_, not via your custom debugging scripts unless they're running _inside_ the authenticated browser session.
